# Exploratory-data-analysis

Choose a dataset that interests you and conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) utilizing libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, or seaborn. Examine the dataset's features, identify patterns, study distributions, detect correlations, and spot any anomalies. Use visual tools like histograms, scatterplots, and heatmaps to uncover valuable insights about the dataset.
